I am Isa Muradli, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. My academic journey has been driven by a deep interest in distributed system, memory management, I/O of high performance computing (HPC) applications. I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the same institution, where I developed a solid foundation in both theory and practical applications.

In addition to my academic work, I have gained valuable industry experience. Most recently, I worked as an Associate Data Scientist at Pepco Holdings - Exelon. In this role, I led the migration of a large database to Azure Cloud, optimized data pipelines, and significantly improved system performance. This hands-on experience has strengthened my skills in cloud computing, data management, and system efficiency. I also developed automated systems and analytical dashboards, contributing to better decision-making and operational improvements across multiple business units.

Earlier in my career, I interned as a Data Engineer & Science Intern at Pepco Holdings, where I worked on data cleaning, performance evaluation, and SQL optimization. I also interned as a Software Engineer at Azerconnect LLC, where I focused on building APIs, enhancing scalability, and developing integration solutions for cloud-based systems.

My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such as Python, C/C++, Java, and JavaScript, as well as expertise in cloud technologies like Azure and AWS. I also have experience working with big data processing frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark. Throughout my academic projects, I have explored topics like decentralized peer-to-peer systems, process management in operating systems, and performance optimizations in large-scale systems.

I am passionate about advancing research in memory systems and software engineering, and I am always looking for new ways to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges.

## How to edit your site's GitHub repository

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
